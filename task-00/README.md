# Install Ubuntu 20.04 [Desktop]
I installed Ubuntu when I was in the amFOSS workshop.


The workshop provided me resources to correctly dual-boot Ubuntu alongside Windows. 


Though it is a fact that I had faced some difficulties while I tried to install Ubuntu on my own.


So after I saw the prompt to write a [blog](https://dev.to/ganesh329/dual-booting-ubuntu-and-windows-1373) in the tasks docs, I did write one to help others overcome the silly errors.
