# Find The Bug
I must admit that my first approach towards this task was not certainly in the right direction :sweat:.


Thought the task was relatively easy, I had overlooked the given resources in the [repo](https://github.com/amfoss/tasks/tree/main/task-05), which would have helped me comnplete it much faster.


After my unsuccessful attempts, I chanced upon the resources and was able to complete the task in a much shorter timespan than I anticipated.


There was a small issue with installing .NET, but I found the appropriate [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu-2204) to install it successfully.


Those who do follow the link, please note that it is for Ubuntu 22.04 only :blush:.
