# Krypto Scrapper
For me this was a challenge to overcome.

This is beacuse I was new to Rust language and I had no idea how to even start the task.

Eventhough the example given was helpful, It was difficult to start from scratch.

A lot of time was spend on resaeching on the subject and on the Rust language. Even after that I had a lot of trouble writing the csv file.

I thought that I will just give it up and do another task.

Then I just did a last attempt and somehow it ended succesful.
