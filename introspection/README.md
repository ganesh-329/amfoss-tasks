# Introspection


## Why must we choose you?
I believe that I would be a valuable addition to team amFOSS because of my passion for technology and my eagerness to learn and grow as a software developer.


Eventhoughmy my venture into the technical field has been very short, nearly 6 months, I believe I have achieved enough skills to showcase as my own. 


I believe that my hard work and perseverance have played a significant role in my personal growth, and this, in turn, will enable me to make valuable contributions to the club's achievements.

## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
Over the 6 months, I plan to improve my technicals skills through projects and workshops. I also plan to improve my knowledge in Java and python. Since I just only know the basics of those two languages, I wish to improve upon them. 


I will also work hard to score good SGPA in my current semester.


If I need to change something in the future, then I will just add to it since this is just a basic abstraction.

## How would you contribute back to the club? 
There are several ways in which I could contribute back to the club. 


Firstly, I would like to share my knowledge and experience with other club members by helping them with their projects and answering any questions they may have.

Additionally, I would like to contribute to the club's open source projects and help improve them in any way I can.

## Do you have any feedback on the selection process?
I believe that selection process is very informative. 

Through completing the tasks I have gained valuable skills that cannot be taught by anyone. 

I think that by doing the given tasks, we become self-sufficient to venture into this field on our own.

This is the case for just attempting the tasks, not just completing it. Completing it just gives us a sense of satisfaction that can't be described through words.

So, overall I think that process is a good simulant for gaining knowledge.
