I really enjoyed completing this task as it provided me with a great opportunity to explore and gain a better understanding of the capabilities of JavaScript. The task involved creating a drum kit website with seven buttons, each playing a different sound when clicked.


The first step was to link the CSS and JS files to the index.html file, followed by adding event listeners to the buttons. The provided audio assets made it easier to implement the functionality of playing the corresponding sound when a button is pressed. The final step involved adding some basic styling to the website to make it look unique and incorporating attractive fonts from Google Fonts.


Overall, this task was an excellent learning experience.
