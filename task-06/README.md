# Flame Game
Up until now, this was one of the hardest tasks I came across.

Although this is not the first time I've heard about **Flutter**, I 've many challenges while installing it.

But, I think that I learned a lot from this task.

Since I had no idea on how to approach the task, I did some Googling and I came across this [site](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#0).

It is a good resource for learning the basics of Flutter.

This task was quite challenging and upon finishing it, it made me feel a sense of satisfaction.
